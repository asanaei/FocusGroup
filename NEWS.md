# FocusGroup 0.5.1

Initial CRAN release.

* `run_focus_group()` is the single high-level session runner. It requires an
  explicit `config`, accepts `n_participants`, `guide`, `flow`, and
  `message_mode`, and performs a model-call cost preflight before live work.
* `run_focus_group()` returns a `focus_group_result` with the stable fields
  `focus_group`, `transcript`, `summary`, `participants`, `usage`, and
  `metadata`. Its print method gives a concise run summary.
* `create_agents()`, `create_agents_from_data()`, and
  `create_agents_from_survey()` construct agent-ID-keyed rosters from supplied
  personas, in-memory records, labeled survey files, and pre-rendered persona
  panels.
* `ConversationFlow` is the public extension base. Built-in round-robin,
  probabilistic, and desire-based flows are constructed with
  `create_conversation_flow()`.
* Model configuration arguments use `config`; group-level configuration uses
  `admin_config`. The `FGAgent` configuration field is `config`.
* The `.runner` seam accepts an experiments data frame with `config` and
  `messages` list-columns and returns those rows with at least
  `response_text`.
* Session logs give every row a unique integer `message_id` and record the
  moderator cycle as `round`, while retaining `phase`.
* `analyze_focus_group()` returns a `focus_group_analysis` with stable fields,
  typed empty components, and an `issues` table. Descriptive analysis runs
  offline. Thematic analysis and model summaries require an explicit `config`.
* `focus_group_from_transcript()` accepts `moderator_id`; when it is omitted,
  speaker identifiers containing `"mod"` provide the fallback.
* `get_default_prompt_templates()` contains only templates used by supported
  package operations.
* `run_focus_studio()` starts the optional Shiny interface for running
  sessions, reading transcripts, and comparing continuations from edited
  histories.
